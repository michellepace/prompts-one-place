> [!TIP]
> Collect powerful prompting words over prompts prompts: Specific either to the industry you are currently in (e.g., mining, banking, manufacturing, digital media, etc.), or the tasks that you are doing. Like words a Designer would know ("modal navigation drawer", "warmer greys", "Tighter information density"), but I don't. Or words an Engineer knows, but I don't ("monolithic", "modular", "single purpose").

Having a collection of right words, means I can easily write:

> *"Create a dashboard with warmer grays and tabular-nums for the financial metrics. Use a tighter information density in the main table, with Less vertical spacing between rows. Make it mobile responsive."*
