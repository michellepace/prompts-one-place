## Design Specification Terms
1. `Warmer grays` - Specifying colour temperature shows design awareness and produces more aesthetically pleasing results
1. `Tighter information density` - Communicates layout priorities without needing to specify exact pixel measurements
1. `Tabular-nums` - Technical CSS property knowledge that solves specific visualisation problems (vertically aligned numbers)
1. `Less vertical spacing` - Direct instruction about spacing that improves readability
1. `Darker than original but not full black` - Nuanced colour instruction showing understanding of contrast principles

## Layout Instructions
1. `Column versus under` - Clear positional language that specifies exact layout relationships
1. `Aligned with` - Precise alignment language that enforces visual hierarchy
1. `Make the width smaller` - Simple dimensional instruction that affects overall composition

## Component Architecture Terms
1. `Break out into components` - Shows understanding of React architecture and modular design
1. `Add logic to it` - Transitions from static design to functional components

## Technical Specificity Terms
1. `Inter font from Google fonts with next font` - Extremely specific typography instruction with implementation method
1. `Size four` - Direct reference to Tailwind's sizing system
1. `Placeholder image/data` - Request for realistic mockup content

## Responsive Design Terms
1. `Mobile responsive` - Triggers responsive design patterns without needing to specify breakpoints
1. `Fix [specific mobile issue]` - Problem-solving approach to responsive design

## Prompt Examples

> Create a dashboard with warmer grays and tabular-nums for the financial metrics.  Use a tighter information density in the main table, with Less vertical spacing between rows. Make it mobile responsive.

This prompt combines colour temperature preferences with specific CSS knowledge and layout instructions, resulting in a more professional financial interface with proper number alignment.

> Generate a product page with the product image aligned with the description in a column versus under it. Use Inter font from Google fonts with next font. Make the width of the description column smaller.

This example demonstrates precise layout positioning with specific typography requirements that would otherwise require multiple iterations to achieve.

> Design a music player similar to Spotify but break out into components for the player controls, playlist view, and now playing section. Add logic to it that updates the now playing information when a track is selected.

This prompt shows understanding of component architecture and requests functional logic, taking the output beyond static design into interactive prototype territory.

> Build an analytics dashboard with electronic music placeholder data. Make the default value of the search input 'electronic'. Adjust the colour scheme to be darker than the original but not full black, and use size four for all icon elements.

This example combines realistic data requests with specific Tailwind sizing instructions and nuanced colour direction, resulting in a more refined and usable interface.

# 🎯 UIUX Designer Words

## Visual Design Principles

`Visual hierarchy`: **Directs attention flow through deliberate sizing, contrast, and positioning.** Eg.2 Provides specific Tailwind classes (z-index values and shadow) that v0.dev can directly implement rather than an abstract request.
1. *Establish a clearer visual hierarchy with the pricing tiers*
2. *Make the pricing tier cards use a z-20 shadow for the recommended option and z-10 for others to establish clearer visual hierarchy*

`Content hierarchy`: **Information importance signalling.** Eg.2 provides exact typography classes for different content levels instead of vague hierarchy requests.

1. *Not in original artifact*
2. *Create clear content hierarchy with text-2xl font-semibold for primary headings, text-lg font-medium for subheadings, and text-sm text-gray-600 for supporting text*

`Negative space`: **Strategic whitespace that improves focus and readability.** Eg2 uses specific Tailwind padding units that v0.dev can immediately apply instead of the vague "increase" instruction.

1. *Increase negative space around card elements*
2. *Add p-6 negative space around cards and increase to p-8 for the featured card*

`Card elevation`: **Visual prominence through shadows and positioning.** Eg2 establishes a complete system of elevation using specific shadow utilities and transform classes

1. *Not in original artifact*
2. *Use three levels of card elevation: shadow-sm for inactive items, shadow-md for standard cards, and shadow-lg with a -translate-y-1 for featured elements*

`Gestalt principles`: **Visual perception laws for unified design.** Translates abstract design theory into concrete Tailwind spacing classes.

1. *Not in original artifact*
2. *Apply the Gestalt principle of proximity by grouping related actions within a space-y-1 container and separating sections with a my-6 divider*

`Skeuomorphism vs. flat design`: **Interface styling approach.** Eg.2 provides implementation-ready Tailwind classes rather than leaving interpretation to the AI.

1. *Add subtle skeuomorphic elements to the flat design*
2. *Add subtle skeuomorphic effects with shadow-md and a 1px border-slate-200 on cards while maintaining the overall flat design aesthetic*

## Accessibility & Usability

`Accessibility contrast`: **WCAG compliance for text visibility.** Eg.2 provides exact colour values and the required contrast ratio, giving v0.dev concrete parameters to work with.

1. *Ensure AAA accessibility contrast for all text elements*
2. *Use text-slate-900 on white backgrounds to ensure AAA accessibility contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for all body text*

`Affordance`: **Visual cues indicating interactivity.** Eg.2 includes specific Tailwind transition and shadow classes that create clear visual affordances.

1. *Make the button have stronger affordance*
2. *Increase button affordance with hover:scale-105 transition effects and an interactive shadow-sm hover:shadow-md*

`Interaction parity`: **Consistent behaviour across devices.** Eg.2 provides a specific class pairing that ensures consistent behaviour across different input methods.

1. *Not in original artifact*
2. *Ensure interaction parity by making hover:bg-slate-100 states have equivalent focus-visible:bg-slate-100 and active:bg-slate-200 states for keyboard/touch users*

## Information & Interaction Design

`Information architecture`: **Structured content organisation.** Eg.2 provides a specific grid system implementation.

1. *Improve the information architecture of the dashboard*
2. *Improve the dashboard's information architecture by using a grid-cols-12 layout with col-span-8 for primary content and col-span-4 for secondary information*

`Progressive disclosure`: **Revealing information gradually.** Eg.2 references a specific shadcn component and animation detail that v0.dev can implement directly.

1. *Use progressive disclosure for the complex settings*
2. *Implement progressive disclosure for advanced settings using a Disclosure component from shadcn with a chevron animation on toggle*

`Micro interactions`: **State-based animations providing feedback.** Eg.2 details exact animation classes, timing parameters, and a specific element to animate.

1. *Add micro interactions to form submissions*
2. *Add micro interactions using group-hover:translate-x-1 transition-all duration-200 to the chevron icon in the dropdown menu*

## Cognitive UX Principles

`Cognitive load`: **Mental effort required for interface use.** Eg.2 provides quantitative limits and specifies component choices. Eg.2 provides quantitative limits and specifies component choices.

1. *Reduce cognitive load in the checkout process*
2. *Reduce cognitive load in checkout by limiting form fields to max 4 per step and using shadcn/Form with built-in validation*

`Decision fatigue`: **Limited user decision capacity.** Eg.2 specifies styling approaches and numerical constraints that create immediately actionable instructions for v0.dev

- *Minimize decision fatigue in the onboarding flow*
- *Combat decision fatigue by using a bg-primary highlight for the recommended plan and limiting feature comparison to only 5 key differences*

# 🎯 Tailwind Words

## Core Tailwind Concepts

`Spacing scale consistency`: **Harmonious proportional spacing using Tailwind's built-in spacing scale.** Eg.2 establishes a systematic approach to spacing with specific value relationships rather than arbitrary spacing.

1. *Not in original*
2. *Maintain spacing consistency using p-4 gap-2 for small components, p-6 gap-4 for medium components, and p-8 gap-6 for large components*
